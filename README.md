# QuoteYourDay
 **QuoteYourDay** is a simple webapp that allows users to post a quote daily and track their emotional status. The app is built using **Python**,
 **Streamlit** and utilizes **SQLite3** as the database management system. Streamlit is used to convert the Python application into a web-based 
 application, making it accessible via a web browser. The app serves as a tool for users to reflect on daily quotes and monitor their emotional 
 well-being.
